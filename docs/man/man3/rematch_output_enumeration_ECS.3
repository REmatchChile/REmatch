.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
An Enumerable Compact Set stores all combinations of outputs through the interface of creating bottom nodes, extend nodes and union nodes such that outputs can be enumerated with constant delay\&. 

Furthermore, memory management is optimized through a node manager, so that memory space is recycled and it is not necessary to allocate memory an extensive amount of times\&.

This structure is specified by the paper: REmatch: a regex engine for finding all matches (Riveros, Van Sint, Vrgoc 2023)\&.

.PP
If a node is no longer used, it should be unpinned, this allows the memory manager to recycle the memory allocated to it\&.
