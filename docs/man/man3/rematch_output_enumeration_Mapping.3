.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
A \fBMapping\fP is also known as an s-tuple, asigns a span to all it's variables\&. 

This is an internal mapping, therefore the spans are assigned to the variable id's, to get the original variable names the \fBVariableCatalog\fP class should be used\&.

.PP
assumptions: inverted_annotations are sorted by document_position, and are functional\&. The current implementation is not optimal, as it traverses the inverted_annotations vector twice\&. Furthermore, if the spans of all the variables are found in a single pass it would be more efficient\&.
