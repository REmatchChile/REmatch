/*
 * Hyperscan example program 1: simplegrep
 *
 * This is a simple example of Hyperscan's most basic functionality: it will
 * search a given input file for a pattern supplied as a command-line argument.
 * It is intended to demonstrate correct usage of the hs_compile and hs_scan
 * functions of Hyperscan.
 *
 * Patterns are scanned in 'DOTALL' mode, which is equivalent to PCRE's '/s'
 * modifier. This behaviour can be changed by modifying the "flags" argument to
 * hs_compile.
 *
 * Build instructions:
 *
 *     gcc -o simplegrep simplegrep.c $(pkg-config --cflags --libs libhs)
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *     ./simplegrep <pattern> <input file>
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *     ./simplegrep int simplegrep.c
 *
